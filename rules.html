        <h2>Phases</h2>
        <p>A round of Scalawag Seas is split into three phases: Initiative, Movement, and Combat.These phases are always repeated each round, but players may skip their Movement or Combat phases if they so choose.</p>
        <p>In this rulebook, we will be using three fictional players named Timmy, Jimmy, and Jhonny to further explain the rules with examples.</p>

        <h3>Initiative</h3>
        <p>During the Initiative phase, each player will randomly be given a number between 2 and 12. This number decides the order of players in each subsequent phase. The player with the lowest number goes first, then the player with the next lowest, and so on. If there is a tie, the players in question will get neww numbers. This phase is repeated every round.</p>
        <p>Timmy, Jimmy, and Jhonny are playing a game of Scalawag Seas. During their first Initiative phase, Jimmy gets an 8, and both Timmy and Jhonny get 7s. After getting new numbers, Timmy gets a 5 and Jhonny gets a 9. For this turn, Jhonny will go first in both the Movement and Combat phases, then Jimmy, then Timmy.</p>

        <h3>Movement</h3>
        <p>During the Movement phase, each player moves his or her ship according to the amount of movement points it has. Each ship has 3 options for movement; Cruising, Full Steam, and Flanking. Cruising is the slowest option, but it offers ships the ability to not only turn but go backward. Full Steam is the middle of the road when it comes to movement, being faster than Cruising and allowing turning but still slower than Flanking and disallowing backwards movement. Flanking is the fastest, but any ship that is Flanking may only go forward; no turning or going backwards while doing so. Each ship may decide to do one of these actions in its Movement phase. Additionally, each ship gets a turning penalty depending on its weight class. Those in the Corvette class have no penalty to turning, Cruiser class ships have a turning penalty of 1, Destroyers have 2, and Dreadnoughts and Super-Dreadnoughts have 3. Please refer to the table below for more information on movement options.</p>

        <p>Jhonny is using a 45 ton boat. Thus, he has 7 Cruising points, 11 Full Steam points, and 15 Flanking points. He decides that his ship will go Full Steam this turn. He moves his ship forward 5 tiles for 5 points, rotates counterclockwise twice for 0 points since his ship is a Corvette, and moves forward again 6 points. He has now used all 11 of his Full Steam points, and since he cannot move anymore, his turn is over.</p>
